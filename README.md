A mini phone book web app.
uses a database to store the contacts
a contact has phone numbers and email addresses only.
the website uses javascript only to view add and modify contacts while the data is pulled from database via php
The php code is able to check if user wants to add new, edit, delete or get all contacts.
the js file on sending a request, uses url variable to perform operations such as edit or delete where contact specific ID is required
while it still sends the information for operation through POST
It uses POST to add a new contact
Uses GET for collecting all the contacts. This is stored as a data array in js and can be used all through the web lifecycle.
Plan to add a Grouping function, such as Favorite Family.
Plan to add an authentication functionality
Plan to make the php part a RESTful API so can be used with even mobile applications
These are possible functions that were thought of but not implemented
